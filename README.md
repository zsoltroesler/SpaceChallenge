# SpaceChallenge
2nd project of UdacityÂ´s [Object Oriented Programming in Java](https://www.udacity.com/course/Object-Oriented-Programming-in-Java) course

The program is about sending a list of items (habitats, bunkers, food supplies, and rovers) to Mars and running simulations on 2 rocket prototypes, which are different in terms of cargo capacity, cost, chance of crashing while landing and while launching. First picking the correct fleet of rockets. Second running simulations on both fleets to determine to efficacy/cost ratio.
